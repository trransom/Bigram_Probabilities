# Bigram_Probabilities

This is a simple Python script that demonstrates the efficacy of bigram probabilities. The program prompts the user for a URL linked to text data. After parsing through the text, it asks the user to enter a list of case sensitive words. It then calculates a table showing the bigram probability for each combination of two words in the list. Afterwards, the user is prompted to enter a sentence composed of the original words. By multiplying the individual bigrams in the table, the ultimate probability of the sentence appearing in the text is computed.
